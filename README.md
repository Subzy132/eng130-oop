# Python OOP

We will be now going through object-oriented Programming

## 4 Pillars of OOP

## Methods/Functions

## Modules

## Libraries and Packages

- You can import any builtin library by stating it at the top of the file
- For example if you were to import the random library it will look like this
- ```python
    import random

    print(random.random)
  ```
- This will now print a random number 
- The benefit of using the builtin libraries is that there is lots of documentations to help learn the library
