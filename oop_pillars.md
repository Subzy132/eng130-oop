# OOP pillars

all about object oriented programming pillars

## What is oop?

It is a way of structuring code into simple, reusable code blocks which you could use to create individual instances of the objects. 

This programming pattern is mainly built around objects and entities. So basically a set of commands to produce a specific responses

## 4 Pillars of OOP

#### Encapsulation 

Encapsulation is a technique of restricting a user from directly modifying the data members or variables of a class in order to maintain the integrity of the data. 

This is done by declaring it as private usign the `__` prefix to denote it as a private attribute

#### Inheritance

To receive a quality, characteristic, etc., from your parents or family.

#### Abstraction

A general idea rather than one that relates to a particular object, person, or situation.

In simple terms, abstraction hides the internal implementations of a process or method from the user. In this way, the user knows what they do but not how it is done.


#### Polymorphism 

The condition of occurrence in several different forms

So, in programming terms, polymorphism refers to the use of a single method/operator to represent different types in different scenarios

## What are the benefits of using OOP

- Implement DRY by using inheritance
- Easier debugging as you'd know exaclty where to look if something broke
- By working in smaller chunks it provides effective problem solving
- The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost.
- The principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs which cannot be invaded by the code in other parts of the program.
-
