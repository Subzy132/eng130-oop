# Functions

# DRY Don't repeat yourself
# reusable - saves time - saves money
# Let's build some functions
# Syntax def name(): - def name() - daf name(): - def name:

def greeting():
    # Greet the user
    print("Hello dear!")
    # pass is a keyword that would just not come up with an error

# unless the function is called it will not do anything
# greeting()
#
# def greet_user(name):
#     print("Hello " + name)
#
# greet_user("subz")
